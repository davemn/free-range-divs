# Free Range Divs!

Have you ever wanted to build a web page that behaves like a desktop?
Think `<div>`s that behave like windows, with dragging and resizing that works the way you expect.

Or maybe you're building a workspace-style app, but need something less rigid than a Kanban board or tiling dashboard.

Or maybe you're making an avant-garde design for your personal website?

`free-range-divs` is for you.

# What's in the box?

Currently it's two React components:

- `<Desktop>` -
- `<Window>` -

# How do I install it?

```bash
> yarn add free-range-divs
```
